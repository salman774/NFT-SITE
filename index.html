                <p><strong>At $33k, this NFT sneaker is super good value!</strong></p>
                <p>If you've got lots of money and you're a bit daft, NFTs are a
                    great way to pay for something that doesn't have any intrinsic
                    value or even exist. Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT
                    bandwagon and spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto images.
                    Our advice: spend the weekend <a href="">crafting an NFT</a> and by
                    this time next week, you'll be a millionaire.</p>

                <p>Is $33k for sneakers too basic for you? No problem! This CryptoPunk
                    (left) is a steal at $6.6 million! Which makes Bag #748 (right) a
                    total bargain at $1.4 million. And by the way, that's not a VS
                    Code screenshot we included by mistake. The eight lines of white text
                    on a black background is the actual NFT we're selling.</p>

                        them, not buying them.</p>
